## Who We Are

There is a problem with the news. People feels stupid and afraid when they see the firstpage of a newspaper or a news portal. It seems like we were bombarded with information after information. We're not even sure if we understand what's being covered at all.

With the growth of the internet, there is so much information out there. It's the most exciting time to be a reader and a lover of media. If you want information you can get it anytime, anyplace. But at the same time there's all these challenges as a reader.
