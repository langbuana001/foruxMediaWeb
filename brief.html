                <br><br>
                
                <h2>Good Evening, Mr. Abdurakhman!</h2><br>
                <p>Ramadhan Kareem! We here at Forux wish you a happy Ramadhan, and the upcoming Idl' El- Fitr. May the blessings of God be upon us all in this holy time of the year.</p><br><br>
                
                <p>So as we understand that Mr. Yuka has contacted you about our intention to have a logo for our site, let us give you some insights of :
                <ul>
                    <li>Who we are</li>
                    <li>What our guiding philosophy, and</li>
                    <li>What we want as our logo</li>
                </ul>
                </p><br><br>
                
                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                <p> We are <u>Forux Media</u>, created at first as a response to Green River College's bad (at least that's how we consider it) newspaper, The Current. We are looking to replace The Current as the main news-hub for every student in campus. The way to do that however, brought us to a bigger goal: <mark>Revolutionize The News.</mark>
                </p><br><br>
                
                <p>Forux was created not just to be a tech company. At it's core, it's a media company. Forux is trying to improve our reader's experience when they're reading the news. In a grander scale, we are trying to make the news <u>as friendly looking as possible.</u></p><br><br>
                
                <h3>Our Guiding Philosophy</h3>
                <p>We are here to revolutionize the way people look at the news. And as every revolution in human history, we need a driving philosophy to guide us through the long road ahead.</p><br><br>
                
                <p>Unlike any other media, which bombarded their readers with elements after elements, information after information, bright contrast, and millions of colors mashed up together. We believe, by keeping our design focused and in-context with our cause, we can provide an alternative to the news reader. Or even convert media hater, into lover. </p><br><br>
                
                <p>If you have browsed around our site, as you can see, we try to keep things simple and clean. Overcomplexity and bombardment of elements is something we heavily avoided. We are no art student, but if this would help: We prefer a <u>minimalist style</u> approach.</p><br><br>
            
                <h3>What We Want</h3>
                <p>So with this state in mind, I think you have all the information you need to design a logo for our site, that is alligned with our cause. <u>Keep it simple, yet professional.</u></p><br><br>
                
                <p>Below we provided some logos that really captures our eye, the ones we are trying to  avoid, and some that are worthy of consideration. <a href="https://1fichier.com/?gb7nucclo2">Click here to download the samples.</a></p><br><br>
                
                <p>Again, we wish you a happy Ramadhan, and the upcoming Idl' El-Fitr.</p><br><br><br>
